# Titanic-Survival-Analysis

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand which factors affected passenger survival.

**1. Data Exploration & Cleaning**
Checked for missing values and filled them using random selection.
Explored passenger details like age, gender, class, and fare.

**2. Data Visualization (EDA)**
Pie charts & bar graphs showed survival rates, class distribution, and gender impact.
Histograms & scatter plots analyzed age, fare, and family influence.
Key finding â†’ Women and first-class passengers had higher survival chances.

**3. Machine Learning Models**
Logistic Regression & SVM were used for survival prediction.
Best model accuracy: 80% (SVM)

**Final Insights**
Females survived more than males.
First-class passengers had better survival chances.
Younger passengers had a higher survival rate.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
**Outcome:** Predicted survival chances using machine learning.
